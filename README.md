# RPi Pico Resources

A repository containing resources I discovered about Raspberry Pi Picos. Also used as a test to use GitHub as a mirror with Gitea as the origin.

This repo mainly focuses on [C SDK](https://datasheets.raspberrypi.com/pico/raspberry-pi-pico-c-sdk.pdf), not [MicroPython](https://datasheets.raspberrypi.com/pico/raspberry-pi-pico-python-sdk.pdf), because I felt there are more references for MicroPython. It specifically targets the [Pico(and w) board](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-pico/) rather than the [RP2040 Controller](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/rp2040/) itself.

Note that this is a personal hobby project, hence there is no set upload/response timeline. I am open to resource suggestions and corrections. Please star the repository if you find it helpful.
